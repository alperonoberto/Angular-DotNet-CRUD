# Simple Angular + .NET CRUD web app
## As simple as that

To launch the project, once cloned in your local machine, follow these steps:

- First, you will need to run the .NET project located inside  FullStack API/FullStack.API. You will need Visual Studio for that.
- Second, locate yourself inside FullStack UI/FullStack.UI. Run a terminal in that folder and execute the following command:
```
ng serve -o
```
The above command will launch the UI in the 4200 local default port.
